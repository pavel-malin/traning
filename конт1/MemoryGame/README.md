# MemoryGame
## _Match pairs and win the game!_

My application is simple memory game, click circles to flip them and remember the image. Your goal is to find pairs of circles with the same image. The game will finish when you collect 8 points - one for each pair. 

## Inspiration

This application was written based on Frontend Mentor [challenge].

## Tech

MemoryGame uses those open source projects to work properly:

- [C++] - back-end
- [Qt] - IDE for cross-platform applications
- [QML] - front-end

And of course MemoryGame itself is open source with a [public repository][MemoryGame]
 on GitHub.
